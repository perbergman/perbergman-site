# Blockchain Finality Patterns
 
Understanding how different blockchain architectures achieve transaction finality.

## Types of Finality

### Probabilistic Finality
- Bitcoin, Ethereum PoW
- Confidence increases with block depth
- Never truly "final" but practically irreversible

### Deterministic Finality
- BFT-based systems (Tendermint, PBFT)
- Finality achieved in single block
- Trade-off: requires known validator set

### Economic Finality
- Ethereum PoS (Casper)
- Finality backed by slashing conditions
- Combines probabilistic and deterministic approaches

## Practical Implications

For enterprise blockchain:
- Deterministic finality preferred for settlement
- Requires careful validator selection
- Network partition handling is critical

The choice of finality mechanism fundamentally shapes the system's trust model.
