# Agentic AI Patterns

Notes on building systems where AI agents can reason, plan, and execute tasks autonomously.

## Key Patterns

### Tool Use
- Function calling as the primitive
- Structured outputs for reliability
- Error handling and retry logic

### Planning & Reasoning
- Chain-of-thought for complex tasks
- ReAct pattern (Reason + Act)
- Multi-step workflows with checkpoints

### Memory & Context
- Short-term: conversation history
- Long-term: vector stores, knowledge graphs
- Working memory: task-specific state

## Implementation Notes

When building agentic systems:
1. Start with clear tool definitions
2. Design for observability from day one
3. Build in human-in-the-loop checkpoints
4. Test failure modes extensively

The key is balancing autonomy with control.
